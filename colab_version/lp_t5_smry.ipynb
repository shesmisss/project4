They said that they were not, and that the drawing was not of a real hat, but of an elephant being swallowed by a snake. They told him that he should stop drawing snakes and concentrate on geography, astronomy, history, and grammar instead. At the age of 6, he gave up his dream of becoming a paint artist and learned to fly an airplane. He has flown all over the world and has been able to distinguish different countries from each other. Whenever he meets someone who seems to be at a higher level of understanding than he is, however, they always tell him that his drawing is a mistake and that it is not of any real significance. He lives his life alone until he has an accident with his plane in the Sahara six years ago and is forced to live in the desert.

The two of them wait until the sun sets. The Little Prince says he loves the sunset when he is sad. On the Fifth day, the Little Prince asks the narrator if a sheep eat flowers. The he says yes, even flowers with thorny stems. The prince asks if the twigs are of any use, and the little man says that they are just for spite. He says that the flowers believe that their stems are weapons against the sheep. The Prince retorts that flowers are weak creatures, and that they reassure themselves that their weapons are terrible. He tells him that the sheep are weak too, and eat the flowers. He explains to the little Prince that the flower is not important, because the sheep have always eaten the flowers, and they have been doing so for millions of year. He adds that if one little sheep ate the flower, it would darken all the stars in the sky. Then he sobs. He is so upset that the little boy is unable to continue. The night has fallen, and it is now time for the little hammer to be put away. He takes the prince in his arms and comforts him. He promises to protect the flower that the prince loves. He draws a rail around the flower so that it will not be in danger. He feels awkward and blunders. He learns to know the flower better. The flower had always been simple, but one day a new type of flower sprouted from a single seed. The seed was blown away from no one. The new flower was not like the other flowers, for it had many petals. It was a troublesome flower to look after, but the prince was happy to do so. One morning, the flower woke up and showed herself. She was dressed in the most beautiful colors, and her petals were perfectly arranged. She yawed and said that she was barely awake.

The Little Prince is bored, so he asks if there is anyone to judge on his kingdom. The king says there is, but he is too old to make a thorough tour of his kingdom and he tires easily walking.

The orders have not changed since the old days, indicating that the planet has been turning faster and faster since then. Now, the orders have to be changed every single minute. The planet is turning faster every minute, meaning that the lamp lighter has to light his lamp every minute to keep it from going out.
