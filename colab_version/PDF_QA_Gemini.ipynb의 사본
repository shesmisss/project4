El rey estaba sentado en un trono dorado y llevaba una capa púrpura con estrellas doradas. Tenía una corona en la cabeza y un cetro en la mano. El rey era muy amable y le dio la bienvenida al Principito a su planeta. El Principito le contó al rey sobre sus viajes y el rey le contó sobre su planeta. El rey le dijo al Principito que era el rey de todo, pero que no tenía súbditos. El Principito le preguntó al rey por qué no tenía súbditos y el rey le dijo que no los necesitaba. El rey le dijo al Principito que él era el único que importaba y que no necesitaba a nadie más. El Principito se sorprendió por esto y le preguntó al rey si no se sentía solo. El rey le dijo al Principito que no se sentía solo porque tenía a sus estrellas. El rey le dijo al Principito que las estrellas eran sus súbditos y que lo amaban mucho. El Principito se sintió feliz por el rey y le dijo que era un buen rey. El rey le dijo al Principito que él era un buen rey porque amaba a sus estrellas y ellas lo amaban a él. El Principito se despidió del rey y continuó su viaje.  The actor in the photo is Curd Jurgens. He was a German actor who appeared in over 100 films. He is best known for his roles in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), The Enemy Below (1957), and The Great Escape (1963).  The picture shows a flower growing in the middle of a desert. The flower is red and has five petals. The stem is green and has two leaves. The flower is facing the sun, which is shining brightly. The background is a sandy desert with two sets of footprints.  The picture shows a scene from the book \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. In this scene, the little prince is standing in a garden of roses. He is looking at the roses and thinking about how they are all the same. He is also thinking about how he is different from the roses. The roses are all beautiful, but they are also all very proud. They are only interested in themselves, and they do not care about anyone else. The little prince is different. He is kind and caring, and he is always looking for ways to help others. He is also very humble, and he does not think that he is better than anyone else. The little prince is a reminder that it is important to be different. It is important to be kind, caring, and humble. It is also important to be true to yourself, and to not let anyone change who you are.  The drawing shows a man sitting at a table. The man is wearing a hat and has a long beard.
