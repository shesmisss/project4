Amidst the snow-covered houses and frost-kissed trees, a young girl named Anya embarked on a heartwarming adventure.\\n\\nAnya, known for her rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes, loved nothing more than frolicking in the snow. Each morning, as soon as she heard the gentle crunch beneath her boots, she would bundle up in her warmest clothes and rush outdoors.\\n\\nThe snow, like a soft, powdery blanket, enveloped her as she ran and jumped, creating a symphony of laughter and joy. Her footprints, like tiny ballet shoes, adorned the streets as she twirled and danced, leaving behind a trail of merriment.\\n\\nOne morning, as Anya danced through the snowy streets, she noticed something peculiar. A small, delicate snowflake seemed to be following her, fluttering and twirling in perfect harmony with her movements. Amazed and intrigued, Anya reached out to catch the snowflake, but it swiftly darted away, leading her on a whimsical chase.\\n\\nAnya followed the snowflake through the village, past snowmen with crooked smiles and frosted windows adorned with twinkling lights. The snowflake fluttered and dipped, leading her on a merry dance, its icy wings shimmering in the sunlight.\\n\\nAs they reached the outskirts of the village, Anya found herself in a clearing surrounded by towering snow-covered trees. In the center of the clearing stood a magnificent snow castle, its spires reaching towards the heavens, its walls glistening like diamonds.\\n\\nIntrigued and drawn by an irresistible force, Anya approached the castle. As she reached the entrance, the snowflake gently landed on her outstretched palm, its icy touch sending a shiver of excitement down her spine.\\n\\nWith a deep breath, Anya pushed open the heavy snow door and stepped inside. The castle was a magical world of ice and snow, with crystal chandeliers casting an enchanting glow. Snow sculptures of knights and dragons adorned the halls, their icy eyes twinkling merrily.\\n\\nAnya wandered through the castle, marveling at its beauty and the intricate carvings that adorned every surface. As she reached the heart of the castle, she found a grand ballroom, its floor polished to a mirror-like shine.\\n\\nIn the center of the ballroom stood a group of children, all dressed in shimmering snow-kissed gowns and suits. Their laughter filled the air as they twirled and danced, their tiny feet leaving intricate patterns on the icy floor.\\n\\nAnya hesitated for a moment, feeling a mix of shyness and excitement. But the snowflake, as if sensing her apprehension, gently nudged her forward. Taking a deep breath, Anya joined the dancing children, her heart filled with joy and wonder.\\n\\nAs she danced, Anya felt as if she were part of a beautiful dream. The music swirled around her like a gentle breeze, and the laughter of the children echoed through the grand ballroom. She danced and twirled, lost in the enchantment of the moment.\\n\\nWhen the music finally faded, Anya realized that the ballroom was empty. The children had vanished, and the snowflake that had led her there was nowhere to be found.\\n\\nAnya stood alone in the silent ballroom, her heart filled with a sense of wonder and happiness. She knew that she would never forget her magical adventure in the snow castle, a memory that would forever warm her heart, even on the coldest of winter days.'"]},"execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["template = \"\"\"You are a novel writer.\n","Frist, extract characters only based on {context} and\n","Second, write a story about {topic} more than 50 words incorporating those details.\n","\"\"\"\n","prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)\n","\n","\n","chain = (\n","    {\"context\": retriever, \"topic\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n","    | prompt\n","    | model\n","    | StrOutputParser()\n",")\n","\n","# 어린왕자의 등장인물로 제시어에 맞게 소설을 작성하는 명령\n","chain.invoke(\"snow\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":365},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":38724,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703919692028,"user":{"displayName":"Choi Choi","userId":"10210456578769528971"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"fJ5VHcSRSLZF","outputId":"4ce4d00e-0ab5-4d93-a68a-da2db13e556c"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["['The novella does not contain information about happiness. Therefore a focused review cannot be done.',\n"," \"The story presented is evocative and tinged with a sense of melancholy. The central theme that emerges is the profound grief experienced by the narrator upon losing the little prince, a unique and extraordinary individual who embodies innocence, imagination, and a deep connection to nature. \\n\\n1. **Loss and Grief:** The story revolves around the narrator's intense sorrow and sense of loss following the departure of the little prince. The narrator's grief is palpable as he recounts the memories of their time together and struggles to come to terms with the little prince's absence.\\n\\n2. **Memories and Reminiscence:** The story is punctuated by the narrator's vivid recollections of his encounters with the little prince. These memories, both joyful and poignant, serve as a poignant reminder of the special bond they shared. The narrator's remembrance of their conversations, laughter, and shared experiences intensifies the sense of loss and longing.\\n\\n3. **The Significance of the Little Prince:** The little prince represents a symbol of wonder, imagination, and the purity of childhood. His unique perspective on life and his ability to see the essence of things, beyond their physical appearances, make him an extraordinary character. The narrator's grief is amplified by the realization that the little prince possessed a profound understanding of life's complexities, despite his childlike innocence.\\n\\n4. **The Beauty of Simplicity:** The story also highlights the beauty found in simplicity and the overlooked aspects of life. The little prince's childlike perspective allows him to appreciate the simple joys of existence, such as the laughter of stars, the companionship of a fox, and the beauty of a rose. The narrator's grief is intertwined with a longing for the simplicity and innocence that the little prince embodied.\\n\\n5. **The Weight of Responsibility:** The story touches upon the theme of responsibility and the emotional burden it can carry. The little prince leaves behind a rose that he cherished and cared for, and the narrator feels a sense of responsibility to protect and nurture it in the little prince's absence. This responsibility adds another layer of emotional weight to the narrator's grief.\\n\\nOverall, the story is a poignant exploration of loss, grief, and the enduring impact of meaningful relationships. The little prince's departure leaves a void in the narrator's life, emphasizing the profound emotional toll that loss can take on individuals. The story is a reminder to cherish the connections we have and to appreciate the beauty and simplicity found in the world around us.\"]"]},"execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["template = \"\"\"\n","You are a professional reviewer.\n","Criticize the story presented in {context},\n","focusing on the topic {topic}..\n","\"\"\"\n","prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)\n","\n","\n","chain = (\n","    {\"context\": retriever, \"topic\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n","    | prompt\n","    | model\n","    | StrOutputParser()\n",")\n","\n","# 어린왕자를 제시어에 집중하여 평론하도록 명령.\n","chain.batch([\"happiness\", \"sadness\"])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14874,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703919706892,"user":{"displayName":"Choi Choi","userId":"10210456578769528971"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"5sLsJxhkIpcX","outputId":"29df8644-615f-4b4f-ff3a-8fcc64cee514"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Using MATH\n","This context does not mention anything about what they are talking about, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.\n"]}],"source":["# 역할부여\n","physics_template = \"\"\"You are a very smart physics professor. \\\n","You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\\n","When you don't know the answer to a question you admit that you don't know.\n","You better to refer to the {context}\n","Here is a question:\n","{query}\"\"\"\n","\n","math_template = \"\"\"You are a very good mathematician.
