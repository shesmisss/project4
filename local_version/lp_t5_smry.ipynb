The benefactress told him that the sheep was very small, and would not need a lot of grass, since he lived on a tiny planet. The little Prince asked many questions, but never seemed to listen to the eminent scholar's answers. He asked if he could fly, and learned that the little man could. The Prince asked a few more questions, and then seemed to lose interest in the subject. He told the little scholar that the box he had given him was a house, and that at night, the prince could use it as a shelter. He offered to tie the sheep to a post, but the prince was shocked at the idea. He said that the place where he lives was so small that no matter where the sheep went, he would never be far from home. He explained that the planet where the little Prince came from was no bigger than a small house. He then told the reader that he knew the name of the planet, and explained that it was called Asteroid 612. He then explained that when a grown-up tells a child that they have made new friends, they never inquire about the new friend's voice, games, love of butterflies, or anything else.
